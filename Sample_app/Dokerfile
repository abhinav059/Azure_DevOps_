# Stage 1: Build the React App

""""  
Added --legacy-peer-deps in npm install

    Helps avoid dependency conflicts in some React projects.

Removed default Nginx configuration (Optional but recommended)

    Prevents issues if Nginx default configs interfere with your app.

Added EXPOSE 80

    Ensures that Docker knows which port the app runs on.

Added CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

    Ensures Nginx stays running instead of exiting immediately.
